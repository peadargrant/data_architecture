<h2 id="usual-reminder">Usual reminder</h2>
<p>The lab servers are not backed up or secure!</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t put any valuable or confidential data on them.</li>
<li>Don’t use your DkIT or any important password on them.</li>
<li>Manage files you create on them by copying them off with sftp or
using the school GitLab server</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="login-to-the-shared-server">Login to the shared server</h2>
<p>First, we’ll login to the shared lab server where you’ve already used
PostgreSQL on a regular basis.</p>
<pre><code>ssh yourname@10.200.172.60</code></pre>
<h2 id="connect-to-mongodb-server-using-mongosh">Connect to mongodb
server using mongosh</h2>
<p>In today’s lab we are going to use a shared mongodb instance. Unlike
Postgres, the MongoDB instances is provisioned on a separate Dell R230
server running Linux in the same rack in P1153.</p>
<p>MongoDB has its own username / password database (and can be
configured for single sign-on but not here). All students have been
provisioned with a mongodb user with the same name as yourself and
initial MongoDB password <code>1Password</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of logging into the MongoDB server over SSH directly, we will
use the <code>mongosh</code> client on the shared server to connect
remotely using MongoDB’s own protocol to the mongod instance.</p>
<pre><code>mongosh --host 10.200.172.57  -u yourusername</code></pre>
<p>Enter your initial <em>mongodb</em> password <code>1Password</code>
at the prompt. You should then get output something like:</p>
<pre><code>Enter password: *********
Current Mongosh Log ID: 67a0fb38a894553a80544ca6
Connecting to:          mongodb://&lt;credentials&gt;@10.200.172.57:27017/?directConnection=true&amp;appName=mongosh+2.3.8

test&gt; </code></pre>
<p>This shows that you are connected to the <code>test</code> database.
You now need to connect to your own.</p>
<h2 id="connect-to-your-own-database">Connect to your own database</h2>
<p>Just as in the case of PostgreSQL, a single MongoDB instance hosts a
number of isolated MongoDB databases. Like with our shared PostgreSQL
installation there is a mongodb database with the same name as your
username to which you have full access. Change to your own database
using the command:</p>
<pre><code>use yourname</code></pre>
<p>Note that the prompt now changes to <code>yourname&gt;</code>,
meaning that commands you enter will now run against your own database
instead of the <code>test</code> one.</p>
<p>Confusingly, MongoDB’s authorization system allows you to connect to
any database in the system, whether you have rights on that database or
not. It will only block when you actually try to do something you’re not
authorized to do. To ensure that you have access rights to your own
database, we’re going to run a command that will cause an error if you
don’t have the right access levels:</p>
<pre><code>show collections</code></pre>
<p>As you’ve no collections in your database, this command should just
return nothing.</p>
<p><em>If you get an error here, ask me for help!</em></p>
<h1 id="document-databases">Document databases</h1>
<p>MongoDB is an example of a <em>Document Database</em> or <em>Document
Store</em>.</p>
<p>A single MongoDB instance hosts multiple databases, each with one or
more collections that each store one or more JSON-structured
documents.</p>
<h2 id="document">Document</h2>
<p>We’ll take a document to mean an isolated unit of structured
data.</p>
<p>You’re already familiar with Python dictionaries and lists.</p>
<p>These can be interwoven to make a document, which can be output (or
dumped) into a number of formats. Primarily this would be JSON, but XML,
YML and other formats are possible.</p>
<h2 id="collection">Collection</h2>
<p>In MongoDB, related Documents are grouped into
<em>collections</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike tables in relational databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no requirement for there to be any similarity between
documents in a collection.</li>
<li>A collection only exists when at least one document is inserted into
it. Empty collections do not exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collections make it easy to search for related documents, and to bulk
delete or update documents.</p>
<h1 id="basic-task-list-example">Basic task list example</h1>
<p>We’re going to build a basic task list to build familiarity with
MongoDB using <code>mongosh</code>.</p>
<p>MongoDB internally uses JavaScript as its native query language,
which is a rather different experience from the SQL that we’ve used to
date. Luckily we only need to build familiarity with a few concepts to
start using it.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Our task list will consist of one or more task items in a single
<em>collection</em> called <code>tasks</code>. Each task will normally
have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>description</strong> human readable description (e.g. mow
the lawn, wash the dishes)</li>
<li><strong>done</strong> boolean if task is complete (true /
false)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-operations">Basic operations</h2>
<p>In MongoDB there is no DDL step as such.</p>
<h3 id="creating-collections-and-items">Creating collections and
items</h3>
<p>Collections and items are created implicitly when they are
inserted.</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.insertOne( { description: &quot;wash the dishes&quot;, done: false } )</code></pre>
<p>The <code>db</code> object represents the database and is always in
scope. Most mongodb commands operate on the <code>db</code> object.</p>
<h3 id="listing-out-all-collections">Listing out all collections</h3>
<p>Now that our collection has been created, it will appear in the list
of collections:</p>
<pre><code>show collections</code></pre>
<h3 id="listing-out-all-contents-in-the-collection">Listing out all
contents in the collection</h3>
<p>We can get all items in a collection once we know its name using the
<code>find</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.find()</code></pre>
<h3 id="adding-more-data">Adding more data</h3>
<p>We can obviously call <code>insertOne</code> as many times as we
like.</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.insertOne( { description: &quot;mow the lawn&quot;, done: false } )
db.tasks.insertOne( { description: &quot;call the electrician&quot;, done: false, note: &quot;ask about discount&quot; } )</code></pre>
<p>Now insert a few extra tasks into your collection.</p>
<h2 id="querying">Querying</h2>
<p>As with SQL, more advanced queries are best learned on an as-needed
basis. There are a few key building blocks that we’ll study now,
continuing on with our task manager example.</p>
<p>We already know that calling the <code>find()</code> method will get
all items in that collection. By adding arguments to the
<code>find()</code> method in the form of JSON we can narrow down the
search.</p>
<h3 id="does-a-field-exist">Does a field exist?</h3>
<p>Given that documents are free-format, we may want to include/exclude
items based on whether a particular field exists or not.</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.find( { &quot;note&quot;: { &quot;$exists&quot;: true } } )</code></pre>
<h3 id="nullity">Nullity</h3>
<p>More confusingly, a field can exist / not exist, but it can also be
null or have a value. Let’s try an insertion like:</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.insertOne( { description: &quot;call the plumber&quot;, done: false, note: null } )</code></pre>
<p>If we now re-run the previous example:</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.find( { &quot;note&quot;: { &quot;$exists&quot;: true } } )</code></pre>
<p>We’ll now see that the null valued field does exist. Given that by
default MongoDB has no schema checking or enforcement, this confusion
could get out of hand if we’re not disciplined in our usage. If we
wanted to find records where the field has a non-null value we can
instead use:</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.find( { note: { $ne: null } } )</code></pre>
<p>Of course our problem of interest will determine how we should handle
field existence and nullity.</p>
<h3 id="combining-criteria">Combining criteria</h3>
<p>We can combine criteria for a single field thus:</p>
<pre><code>db.tasks.find( { note: { $exists: true, &quot;$eq&quot;: &#39;ask about discount&#39; } })</code></pre>
<p>The criteria we include are a logical AND to produce the output
documents.</p>
<h1 id="python-connectivity">Python connectivity</h1>
<p>As we’ve seen with PostgreSQL, databases are most useful when we
connect them directly with our own Python code. This bring rich
capabilities in terms of data visualisation, loading and analysis.</p>
<h2 id="pymongo">PyMongo</h2>
<p>The <code>pymongo</code> library provides connectivity from Python to
MongoDB and allows us to manipulate the returned results in a reasonably
Pythonic style. <code>pymongo</code> is installed on the shared
server.</p>
<h2 id="username-password">Username / password</h2>
<p>When using our own code we still need to authenticate to the database
server. It’s generally a bad idea to hard-code credentials in program
code. Let’s create a config file to store the values using the common
INI format that Python supports to store these.</p>
<p>Create a file called <code>mongodb.conf</code> using
<code>emacs</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>[mongodb]
host=10.200.172.57
username=your-username-here
password=your-mongodb-password-here</code></pre>
<p>We can then use the <code>configparser</code> module in Python to
read this information. Config files are very useful for storing this
type of information. If you’re using source control like Git,
<strong>don’t commit them</strong> to your repository.</p>
<h1 id="product-database-example">Product database example</h1>
<p>One thing document stores in general are very good at is storing data
you’ve ingested from elsewhere, where you didn’t design or don’t know
the schema in advance. They then make it very easy to run queries
against that data compared to storing it as flat files.</p>
<p>We’re going to demonstrate this using information from a few stores
that employ the Shopify sales platform to power their online store.</p>
<p>Shopify happens to provide information on products at
<code>products.json</code> on every site by default. It will return up
to 250 products for a single shopify call.</p>
<h2 id="store-list">Store list</h2>
<p>There a few retailers I’ve found that use Shopify. In
<code>mongosh</code> create a new collection named <code>stores</code>
(adapt the instructions above) and populate 2 of the retailers below as
<code>name</code> and <code>url</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Carraig donn: https://www.carraigdonn.com</li>
<li>Carolyn’s Sweet Shop: https://www.carolynssweetshop.ie</li>
<li>SOS Cookies: https://www.soscookies.ie</li>
</ol>
<p>Output should look similar to:</p>
<pre><code>grantp&gt; db.stores.find({})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId(&#39;67a50545105786f542544ca7&#39;),
    name: &#39;carraig donn&#39;,
    url: &#39;https://www.carraigdonn.com&#39;
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId(&#39;67a5103e105786f542544ca8&#39;),
    name: &#39;SOS cookies&#39;,
    url: &#39;https://www.soscookies.ie&#39;
  }
]</code></pre>
<h2 id="schema-design">Schema design</h2>
<p>Although we don’t need to define columns and datatypes in advance, we
do need to decide on how to break down collections and documents.
Sometimes what we encounter or ingest as a single document encapsulates
a large list of items that’s better organised as a collection of
multiple documents.</p>
<p>In many cases this will depend on how we want to search for and
interact with documents.</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>products</code> JSON dictionary is a list
that we’ll break up. We’ll create a collection called products and will
insert each list item as a document in our Python code.</p>
<h2 id="loading">Loading</h2>
<p>See <code>shopify_load.py</code> as a starting example.</p>
<p>Also note some of the explanations in the comments.</p>
<p>What happens if you run the load script more than once?</p>
<h2 id="deleting-all">Deleting all</h2>
<p>If you want to clear out the (possibly duplicate) items inserted just
run:</p>
<pre><code>db.products.deleteMany()</code></pre>
<h2 id="preventing-duplicates">Preventing duplicates</h2>
<p>Although MongoDB is not a relational database, it can enforce some
basic schema constraints.</p>
<p>There is technically a primary key of sorts in the form of the
<code>_id</code> field.</p>
<p>We can create a <em>unique index</em> to prevent insertion of a
record that already exists. Issue the following command in
<code>mongosh</code> to create a unique constraint on the combination of
<code>store</code> and <code>handle</code> columns that will guarantee a
unique ID.</p>
<pre><code>db.products.createIndex( { &quot;store&quot;: 1, &quot;handle&quot;: 1 }, { unique: true } )</code></pre>
<p>Then re-run the loading script twice and confirm that the unique
index prevents duplicate insertions.</p>
<h1 id="pandas">Pandas</h1>
<p>We previously saw how pandas has an easy interface to read results
from SQL queries. This is quite an easy operation in theory since SQL
result sets result in tables that map directly to pandas dataframes.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient

# as usual up to

df = pd.DataFrame(db.products.find())</code></pre>
<p>Available columns will be filled from each document. There will be
null values if a field doesn’t exist for that document.</p>
