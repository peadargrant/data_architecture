# Timing

The test will be available automatically on Moodle at 18:00.

You can download the question PDF from Moodle at that time.

It is designed for a 2 hour time window.

Uploads will *close* at 21:00.
The extra time is to mitigate any technical issues, and allow time for ZIP file creation, uploading and verification.



# Submission

Submission will be via a named ZIP file directly to Moodle.

Questions will specify the file names to be used (case-sensitive).
It is very important that these file names are adhered to. 


# In advance of the test

Check that you can login to this module on Moodle.
(Very important since we don't use Moodle for day to day class.)


# Generative AI

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are restricted for certain functions in this assessment task.
In this assessment, you can use generative artificial intelligence (AI) in order to fulfill the requirements of questions specifically allowing its use.
Any use of generative AI must be appropriately acknowledged (in accordance with [DkIT Academic Integrity Policy and Procedures](https://www.dkit.ie/about-dkit/policies-andguidelines/academic-policies.html)).
"Using generative artificial intelligence tools (e.g. ChatGPT) in an assessment unless explicitly permitted to do so and with proper acknowledgement, is a form of plagiarism".
