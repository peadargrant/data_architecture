<h1 class="title">VPN lab</h1>
</header>
<p>The VPN service enables you to connect to some resources on campus,
mainly a shared linux server, but later on some more machines, from
outside the lab.</p>
<p>This lab will show you how to connect to the lab VPN. You’ll have to
repeat most of the steps here to connect to the lab VPN and disconnect
from it when finished working.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works">How it works</h1>
<p>A VPN is essentially the same as theoretically plugging a long
network cable into one of the network jacks in the lab. It tunnels
traffic through your computers existing WiFi or ethernet connection via
the internet to a gateway located in DkIT. Your computer temporarily
gets an additional virtual IP address that is within a DkIT range.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>To connect from outside or from WiFi you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supported:</strong> Windows or Mac computer</li>
<li><strong>Unsupported:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Linux apparently works but I have not tested it</li>
<li>Android or iOS device and a suitable SSH app (e.g. Termius, others
available)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="usage-guidance">Usage guidance</h1>
<p>The VPN service is designed solely for accessing specified learning
and teaching resources from remote locations. You are not authorised to
use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>You are free to use the VPN during class time and outside of class
time for your own private study.</p>
<p>As with connecting to any network you should ensure that your
computer is reasonably secure and patched. You may need to consider what
network accessible services (if any) are running from your own
computer.</p>
<p>The VPN service is provisioned through shared hardware and software
that has limits on concurrent users: As a consideration to your fellow
students please connect only when needed for working and disconnect
immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>Issues with the VPN should be reported to me (your lecturer) by
e-mail with as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>Students who abuse the VPN service will be removed from it, will be
unable to complete required class work and may face further
institutional sanctions for breaches of the IT Policies.</p>
<h1 id="task-1-log-in-to-the-vpn-gateway-every-day">Task 1: Log in to
the VPN gateway (every day)</h1>
<p>Open a new web browser window and navigate to <a
href="https://dkitvpn.dkit.ie">https://dkitvpn.dkit.ie/</a>.</p>
<p>Log in with your <strong>DkIT</strong> username, password and
2FA.</p>
<h2
id="task-2-download-and-install-motionpro-client-first-time-only">Task
2: Download and Install MotionPro client (first-time only)</h2>
<p>You will need to install the MotionPro client, through the link on
the VPN page.</p>
<p>Once the MotionPro client is installed you don’t need to open it.
It’ll launch automationally from a link on the web site.</p>
<h1 id="task-3-connect-to-vpn-network-every-day">Task 3: Connect to VPN
network (every day)</h1>
<p>Under the <em>VPN Network</em> heading hit the <em>Connect</em>
button. This will launch the separate MotionPro application to setup the
VPN tunnel. It should show an IP address at the bottom.</p>
<p>(The DesktopDirect button has no function for this module so you can
ignore it.)</p>
<h1
id="task-4-test-connectivity-first-time-only-and-in-case-of-issues">Task
4: Test connectivity (first-time only and in case of issues)</h1>
<p>Open Windows Terminal. Navigate to the folder where this page is.</p>
<p>Use the supplied PowerShell script to test connectivity:</p>
<pre><code>./test_connectivity.ps1</code></pre>
<p>It tries to connect to the database server that we will discuss later
on. You should see the message printed in green:</p>
<pre><code>your connection is ok.</code></pre>
<p>If this doesn’t appear then ask for help.</p>
<h1 id="task-5-using-the-vpn">Task 5: Using the VPN</h1>
<p>At this point you can use the resources you need through the VPN.</p>
<h2 id="connect-over-ssh-to-the-server">Connect over SSH to the
server</h2>
<p>Here we’ll connect to the shared server named <code>dblab</code>
using the command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh yourname@10.200.172.60</code></pre>
<p>Connect using the <strong>server username</strong> assigned to you
and the temporary password given in class. Note that in UNIX generally
you don’t get asterisks for password entry. It looks like the entry is
being ignored but it is going in!</p>
<h2 id="changing-your-server-password">Changing your server
password</h2>
<p>Change your server password using the command</p>
<pre><code>passwd</code></pre>
<p>Following the prompts that appear. Similar to the logon password, you
don’t get asterisks for password entry. It looks like the entry is being
ignored but it is going in!</p>
<h2 id="task-5-disconnect">Task 5: Disconnect</h2>
<p>When you are finished working with the VPN please disconnect to
conserve capacity for your fellow students.</p>
<p>Click the <em>Disconnect</em> button under <em>VPN Network</em>.</p>
