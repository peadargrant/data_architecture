# Description

Students are familiarised with data and its storage within varied IT environments including cloud, onsite and legacy systems. A practical problem-based approach to relational, non-relational and allied data storage technologies is followed. Student analysts will interact with a wide variety of contemporary technologies and will specify suitable data storage systems for varied application domains.


# Learning outcomes

1. MLO1	Utilise industry-standard database systems for analytics workloads.
2. MLO2	Design data storage components based on industry standard relational and non-relational databases.
3. MLO3	Optimise storage and query performance for various database types
4. MLO4	Construct appropriate interfacing for near-realtime heterogeneous data stores
5. MLO5	Develop data architecture to store and process unstructured data in varied formats
6. MLO6	Design suitable hardware and software solutions for data storage requirements in analytics-centric projects


# Module Indicative Content

Content will be a selection of topics from the following:

## Data

Types of data: structured, semi-structured & unstructured data; files, streams and databases; four Vs of data; contemporary global data trends; modelling considerations; acquisition; storage and retrieval patterns; distributing; scaling; common file and stream data formats; compression.

## IT environment
Analytics and transaction processing requirements; client/server data access patterns; analyst-client environment trends; shared file systems; server-centric database storage; mainframe data integration; storage devices; storage concepts (DAS/NAS/SAN); data centre, cloud and hybrid-cloud environments; object storage systems.

## Relational databases

RDBMS system overview [PostgreSQL]; Application domains; tabular data (1-N-F); data types; data manipulation and querying using SQL; views; application query API; multi-table JOINS; foreign-key relationships; E-R modelling; geospatial data handling; user-defined functions; aggregate queries; transactions; ACID properties; replication; sharding; CAP theorem; RDBMS limitations.

## Performance optimisation
Goals of optimisation; query planner and explanation; use of indices; materialised views; caching systems [Redis].

## Non-relational databases
NoSQL characteristics; concept of BASE; implicit/explicit schema; problem-based practical application of range of non-relational database solutions to domain-specific data: document stores [MongoDB], key/value stores [Riak], column stores [Cassandra], graph databases [Neo4J], LDAP directories [Active Directory]; design considerations; ad-hoc and programmatic querying; non-relational facilities within RDBMS systems; RDBMS integration; clustering.

## Unstructured data
Challenges of unstructured data; key application areas; large-file storage solutions; Role of Full-text searching; ETL of file-based data; rich-format data challenges [PDF, DOCX]; RDBMS-based full text search capabilities and limitations; full-text search engines; integration with RDBMS and Document store systems.

# Assessment

There are 4 assessments in this module:

1. **Project 1** (Semester 1 end, 35%)
2. **Test 1** (Semester 1 end, 15%)
3. **Project 2** (Semester 2 end, 35%)
4. **Test 2** (Semester 2 end, 15%)

You are responsible for arranging your personal schedule so that you can meet due dates for the projects and the dates of the class test.
The class tests in particular must be taken on the assigned date/time in person in the laboratory.


# Workload

**Class** 3 hours per week

You will need to read up preparatory material *and* undertake practice in your own time. 


# Technical requirements

It is expected that you will work on the lab computers in DkIT.
Lab computers have all required software for this module installed already on them.
I can only assist with troubleshooting on the approved lab environment.

You will require a working DkIT login / password to access many of the required resources. 

We will do a lot of our work on a shared UNIX server, and make use of the XOA virtualisation environment.
Further details on these envrionments will be given as we encounter them.

The shared server and XOA system are *not* accessible on the WiFi network, and personally owned devices are not permitted to plug into the wired network.

*Remote access arrangements if any to be clarified.*

Of course I encourage you to try out the software and methods from this course on your own devices, but I cannot be responsible for troubleshooting configuration of these.
This is your own responsibility!
